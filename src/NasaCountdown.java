/**
 * Kata: NASA Countdown
 * 
 * The NASA wants to shoot yet another rocket to the orbit. As this is your first day as a wannabe scientist
 * at the ground control, you are very excited. So excited that when the gal responsible for the countdown
 * asks you to bring her some coffee, you accidentally spill it all over her lap and the computer – both are
 * not capable of doing their job now.
 * 
 * But the liftoff is only seconds away. Somebody has to do the countdown – or the rocket can’t start and
 * millions of dollars are lost! In a moment of great bravery you remember you learned how to count (a long
 * time ago in High School). So you take the chance!
 * 
 * The ground control chief will tell you where to start – then count to 0. 
 * (example for ’11’: 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0)
